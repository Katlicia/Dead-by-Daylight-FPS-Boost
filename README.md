Dead by Daylight FPS Boost

How do I use this?
- Open up the zip folder and execute the dbd_script.exe.

Do I get banned from this?
- No, actually the game itself has added the settings in the new patch.

How does it work?
- It disables the Vsync. (Vsync makes your game look better and sharper but it affects the performance.) By disabling it you get better performance.
